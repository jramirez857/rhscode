 * 
Part 1 (1 point)
Complete the soccerStandings method so that it prints out the correct 
number of points for a team in the standings. 
Complete the americanFootballScore method so that it prints the correct score for a team. 
You may need to Google how football scores or soccer standings are calculated.

Test your program by running the main method. See example input/output.

Part 2 (1 point)
Update your methods and the main method so that your American Football 
score considers the number of safeties your team scored.
Update the main method so that it asks about your teamâ€™s goals for and goals against.
 Then update your soccerStandings method so it prints the goal differential.
