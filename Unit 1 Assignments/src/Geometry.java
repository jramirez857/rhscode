/*
 *  Complete the six methods of the Geometry class so that they calculate and print out 
 *  the correct geometric values. Make sure to think about whether an int or a double is appropriate in each case.
 *  Feel free to approximate pi as 3.1419
 *  
 *  Test your program by running the main method of the GeometryTester class. See example input/output.
 *  
 *  Add two methods to this class that will calculate geometric formulas that you choose. Update the main method of
 *  GeometryTester so that your methods are called as well.
